[Mental Health in Technology Industries Survey Analysis and Machine Learning](https://github.com/GenTaylor/SupervisedLearningProjects/blob/master/Mental%20Health%20in%20Technology%20Industries%20Survey%20Analysis%20and%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb): An analysis of a survey taken by random professionals in the technology industry on mental health. It includes visualizations of their views on mental health, how they thought others viewed it, what services were provided for their mental health, and if those services were used. The analysis was followed by machine learning using multiple algorithms including logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines, and gradient boost, in order to predict whether a person sought treatment for mental health issues.
